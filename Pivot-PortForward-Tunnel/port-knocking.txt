Port knocking
we use knockd for port knocking
port knocking is used to open critical ports on demand. 
The connector basically follows a sequence usually specified in a config file and knock some ports in a given amount of time in a given sequence and the secure port is then opened
Suppose we have the secret ports pattern for e.g 1111 2222 3333 4444

we can port knock using the sequence
knock IPAddress 1111 2222 3333 4444
