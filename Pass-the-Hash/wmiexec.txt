Most of the basic commands will still work but you might find yourself limited when trying to piggy-back off this shell to get a full shell. That is where the built-in commands may come in handy, say for example to upload a file onto the victim. If you find youâ€™re unable to execute the files from this shell, you could focus on placing them in a directory that you have access to from another port to execute and get a full shell.
