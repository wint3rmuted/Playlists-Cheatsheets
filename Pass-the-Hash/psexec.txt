We can pass either the full LM:NT hash like we did above… or since the LM is blank, we can replace the LM hash with thirty-two 0’s or we can just leave the leading semi-colon. 
Either way this will indicate that a blank LM is being used. This is useful when you dump the hashes with other tools and they only provide the NT hash value, like mimikatz for example.

Since psexec creates an exe and executes it to setup the reverse shell, it results in us obtaining a full shell. This is not how wmiexec.py and smbexec.py work. 
For example, wmiexec.py uses WmiPrvSE.exe to spawn an instance of cmd.exe, which is a lot more stealthy as this might be a legitimate use case in some environments.
