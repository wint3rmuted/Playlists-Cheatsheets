Group Membership
There are 2 modules that enable us to query group memberships — groupmembership and group-mem. The groupmembership helps us retrieve the groups that a user belongs to.
To run this module, we can use the -o option and specify the user in the USER parameter. The example below shows that the Grace user is a member of the SQL admins and Domain Users groups.
crackmapexec ldap 10.129.204.x -u grace -p Inlanefreight01! -M groupmembership -o USER=grace

With the group-mem module, we can get all the users of a specific group with the -o option and the GROUP parameter. As seen below, the “Domain Admins” group has 3 members — Administrator, Julio, and David.
crackmapexec ldap 10.129.204.x -u grace -p Inlanefreight01! -M group-mem -o Group='Domain Admins'

crackmapexec ldap 10.129.204.x -u grace -p Inlanefreight01! -M groupmembership -o USER=grace
crackmapexec ldap 10.129.204.x -u grace -p Inlanefreight01! -M group-mem -o Group='Domain Admins'
