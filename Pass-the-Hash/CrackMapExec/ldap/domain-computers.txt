Domain Computers
To locate domain computers, the find-computer module searches for specified text. For instance, if we need to find all servers within the domain, we can use the -o option with the TEXT parameter set to “servers”.
We can also look for Windows workstations and servers by searching for “windows” or operating system versions, such as “2003, 2008, 2016”, to identify older systems.
