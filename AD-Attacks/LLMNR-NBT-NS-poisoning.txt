LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
This attack happens when any user or computer request a resource or ip which the network dns fails to resolve(Meaning they either mistyped or requesting non existing resource). LLMNR is a Windows AD feature which tries to resolve request when DNS fails.  We as an attacker can respond to the user using a tool called responder and act as a LLMNR server. LLMNR key flaw is that it requires user hash to work. We request users hash from the user and say we will resolve their request and this way we perform a mitm attack inside a AD network

NOte: This attack assumes we have network access same as the target

    Run responder
    responder -I interface(eth0,tun0 etc) -rdw

    Assume a user on the network tries to connect to a wrong smb share ,we will act as a llmnr server because dns fails and get the hash

    \shre
    we get the hash and now can crack it ,pass the hash etc

Defense against LLMNR poisoning:

    Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS
    If LLMNR is required by the company ,then enforce NAC or network access control which means that only the devices with authorized MAC addresses can connect to the internal network.
    Set comnplex Password policy so captured hash cannot be cracked easily
