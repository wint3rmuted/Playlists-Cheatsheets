Ruby HTTP Server   
Using Ruby to run an HTTP server 
We can also launch an HTTP server with a Ruby "one liner". The command requires several flags including -run to load un.rb, which contains replacements for common Unix commands, -e httpd to run the HTTP server, . to serve content from the current directory, and -p 9000 to set the TCP port:

kali@kali:~$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 9000
