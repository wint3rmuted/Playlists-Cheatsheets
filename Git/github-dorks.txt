GitHub dorks
This is the oldest and most traditional way to access sensitive data from public repositories, and because it's a part of public sources, it can be included in any OSINT research.
What's needed? Only GitHub account and some basic knowledge about programming variables; in other words, the things you'll be looking for, such as database user and password, secret access keys, tokens, etc.

A few random sensitive keywords :

    password
    dbpassword
    dbuser
    access_key
    secret_access_key
    bucket_password
    redis_password
    root_password

It took less than 60 seconds to find the first results of GitHub repositories leaking data about database connections — including usernames and passwords — as you can see below:

Leaking data about database connections
There's an even more effective approach to take, by searching for specific credentials strings in configuration files, such as this example: filename:sftp-config.json password.

Specific credentials strings
As shown, we were able to obtain the IP address, root password and SSH port credentials.

Another tip that may increase your success in finding leaked data is ordering the results, by setting the GitHub filter to 'Recently indexed', as you see below:
Recently indexed

What about smtp login credentials? It's easy by searching for strings like: filename:.env MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com. Output example:
Login credentials

How about SQL dumps? Simply use extension:sql mysql dump, and the results will appear before your very eyes:
SQL dump

There are numerous GitHub dorks that can be used to scan GitHub repositories, including:

    filename:.npmrc _auth
    filename:.dockercfg auth
    extension:pem private
    extension:ppk private
    filename:id_rsa or filename:id_dsa
    extension:sql mysql dump
    extension:sql mysql dump password
    filename:credentials aws_access_key_id
    filename:.s3cfg
    filename:wp-config.php
    filename:.htpasswd
    filename:.env DB_USERNAME NOT homestead
    filename:.env MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
    filename:.git-credentials
