Firewall Rules
List all profile's firewall rules! Is the firewall turned on? If so what’s configured?
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all 
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
netsh firewall show state
netsh firewall show config
netsh advfirewall export "firewall.txt"

Whitelist an IP address in Windows firewall
Here’s a useful command to whitelist an IP address in the Windows firewall:
Now we should be able to connect to this host from our IP address (10.10.15.x) on every port.

New-NetFirewallRule -Action Allow -DisplayName "pentest" -RemoteAddress 10.10.15.x

After we are done with our business, remove the rule:
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "pentest"

List installed antivirus (AV) products
Here’s a simple PowerShell command to query Security Center and identify all installed Antivirus products on this computer:

Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/SecurityCenter2 -ClassName AntiVirusProduct

Identify currently installed antivirus product. By decoding the productState value, we can identify which AV is currently enabled (in case there is more than one installed), whether the signatures are up-to-date and even which AV features and scanning engines are enabled (e.g. real-time protection, anti-spyware, auto-update etc.).

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Remote Desktop (TCP-In)" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389

Allow https in and out
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="https" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=443
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="https" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=443

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="https" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=443 profile=private,public,domain
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="https" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=443 profile=private,public,domain
