Enumerating Group Policy Preferences (GPP)
Group Policy is a set of configurations that enforces and controls specific settings on domain-joined computers and users. Examples of Group Policy settings include password complexity requirements, software installation restrictions, and firewall rules.

To access the GPP information and decrypt its stored password using CrackMapExec, we can use 2 modules â€” gpp_password and gpp_autologin modules.
The gpp_password decrypts passwords stored in the Group.xml file, while gpp_autologin retrieves autologin information from the Registry.xml file in the preferences folder.
As seen in the example below, we obtained the usernames and passwords of additional domain users, which we can use to gain further access to the network.
