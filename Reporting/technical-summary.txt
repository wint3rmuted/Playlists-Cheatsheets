Technical Summary
Should be a list of all of the key findings in the report, written out with a summary and recommendation for a technical person, like a security architect, to learn at a glance what needs to be done.
This section should group findings into common areas. 
For example, all weak account password issues that have been identified would be grouped, regardless of the testing timeline. 
An example of the structure of this section might be:

    User and Privilege Management
    Architecture
    Authorization
    Patch Management
    Integrity and Signatures
    Authentication
    Access Control
    Audit, Log Management and Monitoring
    Traffic and Data Encryption
    Security Misconfigurations

Example Technical Summary
An example of a technical summary for Patch Management is as follows:
4. Patch Management

Windows and Ubuntu operating systems that are not up to date were identified. These are shown to be vulnerable to publicly-available exploits and could result in malicious execution of code, theft
of sensitive information, or cause denial of services which may impact the infrastructure. Using outdated applications increases the possibility of an intruder gaining unauthorized access by exploiting
known vulnerabilities. Patch management ought to be improved and  updates should be applied in conjunction with change management.
