Crack Public Key
RsaCtfTool will try a bunch of different well known cryptography attacks against a public key. I’ll clone it on to my machine, and run it, giving it the public key and --private so that it will show the private key if it cracks it. After a few minutes, it does:

mute@hacks$ /opt/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool.py --publickey rootauthorizedsshkey.pub --private

Results for rootauthorizedsshkey.pub:

Private key :
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

I’ll save that to a file and chmod it to 600 so SSH will use it.
