- Default Software Configurations for admin console of webapp
```
https://www.target.com/admin
https://www.target.com/admin-console
https://www.target.com/console
https://admin.target.com

## 1. Getting access through third party services

* When the admin console login page is working on a third party service,then just search for it's default credentials on Google
* Third Party service URL are of the format: https://target.<TPS Name>.com/login
* Some examples are Okta,WP etc

## 2. Bypass to get access to login page
```
1. This bypass is used when you are forbidden to get access to admin login page
2. We use Header Injection for this bypass
3. `X-Orginal-URL: /admin` or `X-Rewrite-URL:/admin`
4. Use this Header under Host
