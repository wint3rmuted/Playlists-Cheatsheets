Find writeable files in a linux box if you want to download an exploit.

find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null      # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-executable folders
find / \( -perm -o w -perm -o x \) -type d 2>/dev/null   # world-writeable & executable folders
find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls 2>/dev/null   # world readable and writeable folders - maybe a cron job running as root :)

Find a file with a particular name
find / -type f -exec grep -l "flag.txt" {} \;  

Find filtering by path, filename, and permissions
find /path -iname "FILTER" -perm PERM

Find with flags used to list or delete files found
find /path -iname "FILTER" -ls

Find with grep to quickly identify files of interest
find /path -iname "FILTER" -exec grep -i "CONTENT" {} \;

Find things like shadow.bak etc
find / -iname "shadow*"

find with flags used to list or delete files found (w/error redirection)
find / -iname "shadow*" -ls 2>/dev/null  

find results can also be filtered by file permissions as well (-perm) flag
find / -iname "shadow*" -perm /o+r -ls 2>/dev/null  

find with grep to search for strings inside of files:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -i 'pass' {} \;  

find with grep to quickly identify files of interest:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -li 'pass' {} \;  

find with egrep to quickly identify files of interest using regular expressions:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec egrep -li "^.+@.+$" {} \;  

Syntax: Recursively list all hidden files and directories on Linux/Unix
The basic syntax is as follows:
find /dir/to/search/ -name ".*" -print

OR
find /dir/to/search/ -name ".*" -ls

OR search only hidden files:
find /dir/to/search/ -type f -iname ".*" -ls

OR search only hidden directories:
find /dir/to/search/ -type d -iname ".*" -ls

OR
find /dir/to/search -path '*/.*' -print
find /dir/to/search -path '*/.*' -ls

Find files based in attributes e.g.; list files that are text, ascii, unicode etc etc
file /home/bandit4/inhere/*

Find a readable file, that is not executable, and has a certain size (within same directory)
find -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
