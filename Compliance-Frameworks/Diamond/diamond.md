## Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
```
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis An intrusion analysis model that focuses on adversaries, infrastructure, victims, and capabilities using a diamond shape to guide analysis
through the connected vertices.

The Theory of Diamond Model
The diamond model of intrusion analysis is an approach employed by several information security professionals to authenticate and track cyber threats. According to this approach, every incident can be depicted as a diamond. This methodology underlines the relationships and characteristics of four components of the diamond—adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. These four core elements are connected to delineate the relationship between each other which can be analytically examined to further uncover insights and gain knowledge of malicious activities. 

Adversary
An adversary is an organization or threat actor responsible for leveraging a capability against a victim to fulfill its goals. 

Capability
The capabilities refer to the tools and techniques used by an adversary in an event. 

Infrastructure
The infrastructure includes the physical or logical communication structures such as IP or e-mail addresses, domain names, and others, employed by an adversary to deliver a capability. 

Victim
A victim is a target against whom attacks are initiated, vulnerabilities are exploited, or capabilities are used. It can be organizations, people, or assets, such as target email or IP addresses, domains, and so on. 

In simpler terms, the diamond model of intrusion analysis illustrates that an “adversary” uses a “capability” over an “infrastructure” against a “victim.” According to the principle of this model, for every intrusion, an adversary moves toward its goals by leveraging capabilities on infrastructures against victims to create an impact. This axiom means that an act of intrusion indicates how the attacker exhibits and employs different capabilities and methodologies over infrastructure against a victim.
