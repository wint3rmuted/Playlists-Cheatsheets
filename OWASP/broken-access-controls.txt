Broken Access controls
The goal of this is to either see data of other users or act on behalf of them

This vulneribilty can also be majorly refered as IDORS (insecure direct object references). In this attack we are able to access data or privileges of a user which we should not have access to. Or if we can access a directory which should be restricted to low priv users. like in a url we have ?id=4 and if we change it to 5,we can see data of another user which we should not be able to see

    Access to pages by tampring a parameter value
    Accessing api endpoints by different http methods (put,delete,post) etc and upload or delete something
    Abusing or tampering tokens and JWT parameter values for e.g admin=false and change it to admin=true to get access to admin privileges

    We can change cart price,or give review on behalf of other users using this vuln

    When submitting something in a form always inspect element and wherever hidden attribute is used like in passwords we see ****** as a placeholder,we can actually remove the hidden="" or set hidden to false from there and the value will reflect in page if vulnerable.THis way we can get sensitive information like passwords,userid etc
