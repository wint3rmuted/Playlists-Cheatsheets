Broken Authentication
    Try default credentials and common credentials like admin/admin etc.
    Try to find valid usernames by the server response. For eg (Invalid password error indicates username is correct but password is invalid)
    If Forgot password functionality provides knowledge based question reset ,the question only appears if we provide a valid username hence leading to usernames exposure. Also these questions are easily guessable
    After login as a user ,take note of their session token/id/cookie etc and logout and login again to see this session key is reused or rotated.
