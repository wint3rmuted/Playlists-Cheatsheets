Squid Proxy
squid proxy or any other proxy

    If we see any proxy running on any port then we have to access that proxy using proxychains
    Go to /etc/proxychains4.conf and below there add http ipaddress port
    now we can use any commands with proxychains and will bypass the proxy running on target server
    We can do port scan with proxychains to see any open ports which were being blocked before
    Now we will tunnel all the further exploitation or enumuration with via proxychains
