Rsync
Rsync works like ftp and is used to synchronise files in shared environment
To see available shares

    nmap -sV --script "rsync-list-modules" -p
    OR rsync -av --list-only rsync://192.168.0.123/

To see the available shared content

    rsync $ip::sharename

 or

    rsync -av --list-only rsync://192.168.0.123/shared_name

To copy the contents to our local machine

    rsync -av rsync://IP:PORT/shared_name

UPload to rsync server

    rsync ./myfile.txt $ip::sharename/restofpath
