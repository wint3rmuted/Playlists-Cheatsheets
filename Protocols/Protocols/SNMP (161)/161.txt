To scan for open SNMP ports, we can run nmap, using the -sU option to perform UDP scanning and the --open option to limit the output and display only open ports.

Using nmap to perform a SNMP scan
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sU --open -p 161 192.168.50.1-254 -oG open-snmp.txt
PORT    STATE SERVICE
161/udp open  snmp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.49 seconds

Alternatively, we can use a tool such as onesixtyone,2 which will attempt a brute force attack against a list of IP addresses. 
First, we must build text files containing community strings and the IP addresses we wish to scan.

kali@kali:~$ echo public > community
kali@kali:~$ echo private >> community
kali@kali:~$ echo manager >> community

kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 192.168.50.$ip; done > ips

Using onesixtyone to brute force community strings:
kali@kali:~$ onesixtyone -c community -i ips
